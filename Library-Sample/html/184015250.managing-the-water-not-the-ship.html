<h2>Abstract</h2><p>This essay examines a largely unarticulated problem at the center of modern management: how to act responsibly in systems where coordination is increasingly governed by protocols that succeed by becoming invisible. Drawing on the ecological perspective articulated in Protocolized’s recent essay, “<em><a href="https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/theorizing-protocolization-i-new">Theorizing Protocolization I: New Nature</a></em>,” the essay reframes protocols as living formations that emerge, stabilize, entangle, and decay over time. As protocols harden into infrastructure, traditional management instincts—visibility, command, and direct control—become progressively misaligned with how these systems actually function.</p><p>To clarify this tension, the essay places contemporary leadership narratives in dialogue with protocol theory, using the book <em><a href="https://davidmarquet.com/books/turn-the-ship-around-book/">Turn the Ship Around!</a></em> as a boundary case. The submarine, with its extreme safety constraints and closed operational environment, exemplifies a domain where intensive<em> intra-protocol </em>management remains necessary and effective. Yet the same leadership techniques falter when extended to open, networked, and planetary systems shaped by overlapping protocols and accelerating automation. This contrast reveals a critical distinction between optimizing behavior within a protocol and stewarding the conditions under which protocols themselves take form.</p><p>Building from this insight, the essay develops a taxonomy of managerial action relative to protocols. It identifies distinct modes of intervention, including execution management, interpretive stabilization, environmental shaping, structural protocol change, inter-protocol coordination, lifecycle stewardship, regulation of protocolization rates, and intentional non-intervention. Each mode carries its own legitimacy, mechanisms, and characteristic failure patterns when misapplied. The taxonomy is presented as a diagnostic framework rather than a prescriptive tool, designed to help practitioners recognize category errors that arise when the wrong mode of management is applied to a given situation.</p><p>The essay concludes by considering the implications of this framework for AI-mediated systems, where behaviors can harden into infrastructure faster than social understanding can adapt. In such environments, effective management increasingly depends on restraint, ecological awareness, and the careful shaping of conditions that determine when coordination becomes irreversible.</p><h2>I. Protocol Waters</h2><p>Modern management operates within an environment that feels increasingly paradoxical. Coordination appears more automated and yet more fragile. Systems scale smoothly until they fail abruptly. Rules proliferate even as responsibility becomes diffuse. These conditions are often described in terms of complexity, technology, or speed, yet such descriptions obscure a more basic shift in how coordination itself is produced and maintained.</p><p>The perspective developed in <em>Theorizing Protocolization I: New Nature</em> offers a useful corrective. Rather than treating coordination as the outcome of deliberate managerial design, it frames it as the result of protocolization: the gradual hardening of repeated behaviors, expectations, and interfaces into background infrastructure. Protocols, in this view, are living formations that emerge through use, stabilize through repetition, and recede from attention as they succeed. Their effectiveness is driven by the degree to which they no longer require conscious management.</p><p>This ecological framing challenges ingrained managerial instincts. Visibility, oversight, and direct intervention have long served as proxies for responsibility and competence. Yet as protocols harden into infrastructure, these instincts increasingly target the wrong layer of the system. Intervening where coordination has already become habitual often produces brittleness rather than control, and attempts to reassert visibility can disrupt the very conditions that make large-scale coordination possible.</p><p>The problem, then, is a mismatch between traditional modes of managerial action and the layers at which coordination now operates. Managers are frequently called upon to “manage” without a shared language for distinguishing between managing execution, shaping protocol environments, revising protocol structures, or regulating the pace at which behaviors become irreversible. Before prescriptions are offered, this mismatch must be made legible.</p><h2>II. Command vs. Conditions</h2><p>The contrast introduced by <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> becomes sharper when examined on its own terms. The submarine is a vivid setting; it is also an extreme organizational environment. Nuclear propulsion, confined space, and irreversible failure modes combine to produce conditions under which ambiguity is costly and delay is dangerous. Authority must be clear, protocols must be explicit, and deviations must be surfaced immediately. In such environments, coordination cannot be allowed to fade into the background. It must remain visible, inspectable, and enforceable.</p><p>What <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> demonstrates with unusual precision is how agency can be redistributed within these constraints without weakening the protocol itself. The book does not argue for loosening rules or relaxing standards. On the contrary, it assumes the protocol’s legitimacy and treats it as non-negotiable. The managerial innovation lies elsewhere: in how decision-making authority is exercised within the protocol boundary. For example, when L. Marquet describes shifting from orders to statements of intent—“I intend to…”—the captain transfers cognitive responsibility downward while preserving structural control upward. Execution remains tightly coupled to protocol, but judgment is pushed closer to the point of action.</p><p>This move is often mischaracterized as cultural or motivational. An alternative interpretation is that the change is procedural. It represents a method for managing <em>protocol</em> <em>interpretation</em> rather than structure. The protocol remains intact, but the burden of sensemaking is redistributed. Officers must articulate their understanding of the protocol’s requirements before acting, making intent legible without dissolving hierarchy. The result is higher local competence, faster error detection, and improved resilience under stress.</p><p>Crucially, this is not an example of protocol evolution. <em>The submarine’s operating procedures do not change</em>. Nor is it an example of environmental shaping; the surrounding conditions remain deliberately hostile and tightly constrained. What <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> achieves is <strong>intra-protocol efficacy</strong>. It refines how humans operate within an explicit, enforced system whose boundaries are stable and whose authority structure is uncontested.</p><p>This distinction matters. The effectiveness of the approach depends on the very features that make the submarine an outlier: closure, ownership of the protocol, and unambiguous authority. Within such environments, command-based control supplemented by interpretive decentralization is both appropriate and necessary. The success of the model, however, rests on assumptions that do not hold in more open, networked, or protocol-saturated systems. Recognizing this boundary is essential before extending its lessons beyond the conditions that make them viable.</p><h2>III. Different Waters</h2><p>The success of <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> invites a natural extrapolation. If redistributing authority and clarifying intent can transform performance under extreme conditions, it is tempting to assume that similar leadership techniques should generalize across domains. Many contemporary management reforms proceed on this assumption, treating organizational dysfunction as a problem of insufficient empowerment, unclear intent, or outdated command structures. The risk lies in the environments to which these techniques are applied.</p><p>The submarine environment embeds a set of assumptions that rarely hold elsewhere. The protocol is singular and owned. The operational boundary is closed. Authority is legitimate and legible. Most importantly, the consequences of deviation are immediate and non-negotiable. These conditions make it possible to optimize coordination by refining how humans reason within a stable protocol. The water is turbulent yet contained.</p><p>Modern organizational systems increasingly operate in different waters. Supply chains span jurisdictions. Digital platforms mediate behavior across millions of loosely coupled actors. In such varying contexts, no single actor owns the protocol, and no clear boundary contains its effects. Coordination emerges from <em>tangles: </em>overlapping rules, interfaces, incentives, and defaults that evolve faster than any individual manager can track. Authority is fragmented, and accountability is often retrospective rather than directive.</p><p>When leadership techniques optimized for closed systems are applied to these environments, they tend to produce a familiar pattern. Visibility increases without corresponding control. Intent statements proliferate without stabilizing interpretation. Decision rights are delegated into systems whose behavior is already shaped by infrastructural constraints. The result is not empowerment. Instead, it becomes a form of performative agency layered atop dynamics that remain unaddressed. Management becomes theatrical, asserting influence where leverage is minimal.</p><p>The core misalignment is ecological. Leadership models that presume a stable protocol boundary struggle in environments where coordination has already migrated into infrastructure. In such systems, the most consequential decisions concern how protocols interact, harden, and disappear from view; they are not limited to how actors behave <em>within</em> a protocol. Techniques designed to optimize execution cannot substitute for interventions that shape <strong>conditions</strong>.</p><p>The challenge for modern management is to go beyond command-oriented models altogether, and to develop the capacity to distinguish when they are appropriate and when they are addressing the wrong layer of the system. Without this distinction, well-intentioned leadership risks becoming noise in waters governed by currents it does not control.</p><h2>IV. Management as Forestry</h2><p>The contrast between closed, commandable systems and open, tangled protocolized environments suggests the need for a different managerial metaphor. Leadership models grounded in execution and intent presume a captain and a vessel. Protocolized systems more closely resemble managed landscapes. In these settings, outcomes are shaped primarily by long-term stewardship of conditions. Management operates through interventions that influence growth, interaction, and decay over time.</p><p>Forestry provides a useful analogue. A forester shapes the environment in which trees grow: spacing, light access, species mix, soil quality, and firebreaks. Interventions are often indirect and delayed. Their effectiveness is assessed probabilistically rather than causally. Crucially, restraint is as important as action. Over-management can be as destructive as neglect.</p><p>Applied to protocolized systems, this perspective reframes managerial responsibility. Coordination emerges from repeated interaction under stable conditions. Protocols harden when behaviors encounter low friction, clear incentives, and predictable interfaces. They decay when environments change or when accumulated complexity exceeds absorptive capacity. Management, in this sense, transitions from behavioral monitoring and control, to regulating the conditions under which coordination becomes durable, reversible, or brittle.</p><p>This reframing also clarifies the limits of cognition-focused interventions. In environments where coordination has migrated into defaults and infrastructure, asking individuals to “think better” or “own decisions” addresses only the visible layer of activity. The deeper drivers lie in environmental design: how systems reward repetition, how interfaces constrain choice, and how errors propagate. Forestry-oriented management targets these drivers by adjusting the terrain rather than the actors.</p><p>Importantly, forestry does not imply passivity, although it can include planned non-activity. It requires active monitoring, selective intervention, and an understanding of temporal dynamics. Some areas benefit from pruning; others from controlled burns; still others from deliberate non-intervention. The skill lies in recognizing which mode is appropriate at which moment.</p><p>From this perspective, the managerial challenge is not to manage protocols directly (this is virtually impossible given their invisibility and nature), but to manage the environments in which protocols form and interact. Doing so requires abandoning the expectation of immediate feedback and embracing longer time horizons, indirect influence, and uncertainty as structural features of coordination at scale.</p><h2>V. The Multiplicity of “Protocol Management”</h2><p>The phrase <em>protocol management</em> carries an intuitive appeal. It suggests a bounded object, a defined set of steps, and a manager positioned above it—monitoring adherence, correcting deviations, and refining execution. This image aligns well with familiar managerial artifacts: checklists, dashboards, compliance reviews. It is also deeply misleading.</p><p>The problem is that protocols do not exist as a single layer or bounded technology. Protocols operate simultaneously as rules, as interpretations, as habits, as environmental constraints, and as interlocking components of larger systems. Treating them as unitary objects invites a category error: interventions aimed at one layer are routinely applied to another. The result is a predictable set of pathologies—over-enforcement where environmental design is required, structural rewrites where interpretive clarification would suffice, or leadership theater where ecological adjustment is the only effective lever.</p><p>The contrast between domains makes this visible. On a nuclear submarine, managing <em>execution</em> works. The protocol boundary is clear, ownership is uncontested, and the consequences of deviation are immediate. The managerial challenge is to optimize how humans operate within a known and stable protocol, not to question the protocol’s existence or scope.</p><p>In traffic systems, the same approach fails catastrophically. Attempting to manage speed through continuous enforcement or exhortation produces congestion, evasion, and fragility. The effective interventions occur elsewhere: road design, lane width, signal timing, and default flows. The protocol governing driver behavior is shaped by conditions, not commands. Applying execution-focused management to this environment misunderstands the layer at which coordination actually occurs.</p><p>This distinction clarifies the role of <strong>Turn the Ship Around!</strong>. Read through the lens of protocol theory, its interventions are precise. The book operates almost entirely within the protocol boundary. It manages execution by redistributing authority and manages interpretation through disciplined articulation of intent. It does not attempt to redesign the protocol, alter its environment, or regulate its interaction with other systems. Importantly, it would be inappropriate for it to do so. The effectiveness of the approach depends on leaving those layers untouched.</p><p>Asking what <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> does <strong>not</strong> manage proves insightful. It does not manage the <em>lifecycle</em> of the protocol. It does not manage <em>interactions</em> with external systems. It does not manage the <em>rate</em> at which behaviors harden into infrastructure. These omissions are boundary conditions of the domain.</p><p>This observation leads to a reframing. There is no single act called “managing a protocol.” There are distinct modes of managerial intervention, each operating at a different layer relative to protocolization. Each mode carries its own legitimacy, mechanisms, and risks. Effective management then depends on identifying the layer at which intervention is warranted. The framework that follows formalizes this distinction as a way to avoid acting competently at the wrong level.</p><blockquote><h3>Case Study: New York City Traffic</h3><p><em>For decades, New York attempted to control vehicle speed primarily through <strong>continuous enforcement and exhortation</strong>: posted speed limits, police patrols, warning signage, and later automated speed cameras. Despite these measures, speeding remained common, particularly on wide arterial roads. Enforcement produced predictable secondary effects. Drivers learned where cameras were located and slowed briefly before accelerating again. Police presence created localized compliance but displaced speeding to adjacent streets. Traffic flow became brittle: minor disruptions cascaded into congestion as drivers reacted abruptly to enforcement cues rather than road conditions.</em></p><p><em>Beginning in the mid-2010s, the city shifted its intervention layer under the <strong>Vision Zero</strong> program. Instead of intensifying enforcement alone, the Department of Transportation implemented <strong>road diets</strong> on corridors such as Queens Boulevard and Prospect Park West. These changes reduced lane widths, added protected bike lanes, shortened crossing distances, adjusted signal timing, and altered default turning geometries. Importantly, speed limits did not change, and enforcement levels often remained constant.</em></p><p><em>The result was a structural change in behavior. Average vehicle speeds dropped without continuous policing. Compliance became ambient rather than performative. Collision rates and fatalities declined significantly, and traffic flow became more stable because drivers responded to physical constraints rather than episodic enforcement signals. Speed regulation shifted from an execution problem to an environmental one.</em></p><p><em>This case illustrates the category error at stake. Managing speed as an execution problem—by telling drivers to slow down or catching them when they do not—assumes control operates at the level of individual intent. In practice, speed is governed by defaults embedded in road geometry and signal design. Effective management intervenes at that layer. The protocol governing driver behavior is not enforced so much as made inevitable by the conditions in which driving occurs.</em></p></blockquote><h2>VI. Protocol Management Framework Overview</h2><p>Once the illusion of a singular act called “managing a protocol” is set aside, multiplicity comes into focus. Each following layer corresponds to a different relationship between managerial action and the process of protocolization itself. Confusion arises when these layers are collapsed, and when techniques effective at one layer are applied uncritically to another.</p><ul><li><p>At the most immediate layer is <strong>execution management</strong>. Here, management focuses on behavior at the moment of action: whether steps are followed, thresholds respected, and deviations corrected. This mode presumes that the protocol is explicit, stable, and legitimate. As illustrated by submarine operations, hospitals, and nuclear facilities, execution management is indispensable where error costs are high and coordination must remain visible. Its effectiveness depends on clarity of ownership and immediacy of feedback.</p></li><li><p>A second layer concerns <strong>interpretive management</strong>. Protocols rarely specify their own application exhaustively. Ambiguity, edge cases, and contextual variation require shared understanding. Management at this layer stabilizes meaning rather than behavior. Techniques such as intent signaling, canonical examples, and adjudication of borderline cases operate here. <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> demonstrates this mode with unusual discipline: authority is preserved while interpretation is decentralized. This layer remains intra-protocol, but it governs how actors reason within it.</p></li><li><p>Beyond these layers lies <strong>environmental management</strong>, where coordination is shaped indirectly. Instead of telling actors what to do, management alters defaults, incentives, and affordances so that desired behavior becomes automatic. Road design, software interface defaults, and workflow configuration exemplify this mode. Here, protocols no longer appear as rules to be followed but as constraints embedded in the environment. Management influence is <em>probabilistic</em> rather than directive, and success is marked by invisibility.</p></li><li><p>A fourth layer involves <strong>structural protocol management</strong>: direct modification of the protocol itself. Versioning, amendment, and formal redesign occur at this level. These interventions are inherently disruptive and carry high coordination costs. They are appropriate when environmental changes render existing protocols unfit, but they are often misused to address problems that originate elsewhere.</p></li><li><p>At a higher level still is <strong>inter-protocol management</strong>, which addresses interactions among multiple protocols operating simultaneously. Modern systems are rarely governed by a single protocol; they are shaped by tangles of overlapping rules, interfaces, and incentives. Failures at this layer manifest as cascading disruptions rather than local errors. Effective management here focuses on interfaces, sequencing, and shared resources rather than compliance with any one protocol.</p></li><li><p>Finally, there are layers concerned with <strong>time and rate</strong>. <strong>Lifecycle management</strong> addresses how protocols age, fade into invisibility, or become obsolete, while <strong>protocolization-rate management</strong> regulates how quickly behaviors harden into irreversible infrastructure. These layers are largely absent from traditional management discourse, yet they increasingly determine system resilience, particularly in AI-mediated environments.</p></li></ul><p>Taken together, these layers form an ecology of management approaches. No single layer is superior. Each has legitimate domains of application and characteristic failure modes when misapplied. The managerial challenge is to diagnose which layer a problem occupies. Competence at the wrong layer produces outcomes that appear disciplined while remaining ineffective. The framework that follows makes these layers explicit, and can help reduce the likelihood of acting precisely where intervention cannot work.</p><h2>VII. Table: Protocol Management Layers</h2><p>Each row in the following table describes a distinct mode of managerial intervention for protocol systems. The modes differ along several dimensions: the object being managed, the mechanism of influence, the degree and type of authority exercised, and the characteristic pathologies that emerge when the mode is misapplied.</p><p>Importantly, the modes are not ordered by maturity, sophistication, or moral priority. In closed, high-risk environments, execution management remains indispensable. In open, networked systems, environmental and inter-protocol management often dominate. No single mode generalizes across contexts.</p><p>The table should therefore be read diagnostically. Its purpose is to help practitioners and analysts ask a prior question before selecting techniques or tools: <em><strong>At what layer can coordination be best shaped?</strong></em><strong> </strong>Only once that question is answered does it become meaningful to debate leadership style, governance structure, or organizational design.</p><p>By making these layers explicit, the framework aims to reduce the likelihood of competent action applied at the wrong level. It offers a shared vocabulary for discussing protocol-related management without collapsing fundamentally different forms of intervention into a single, misleading category.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png" width="1200" height="665.1098901098901" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:807,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:675846,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://npcmemo.substack.com/i/184015250?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-large" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s2zw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cfb1d9b-b679-49b5-b840-3f1abb6ba94e_2558x1418.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>VIII. Strange New Currents</h2><p>The managerial implications of protocolization become most acute in the context of AI-mediated systems. These systems differ from traditional organizations in ways that render familiar leadership metaphors increasingly unreliable. AI systems are not crews. They do not acquire judgment through socialization, nor do they internalize values through shared experience. Their learning occurs through repetition, optimization, and feedback at scales and speeds outside of regular human sensemaking tempos. As a result, coordination may harden into infrastructure before its consequences are fully understood.</p><p>This acceleration creates a distinctive governance challenge. When AI systems behave unexpectedly or produce undesirable outcomes, the instinctive response is to reach for leadership frameworks: clearer intent, stronger oversight, tighter accountability. Yet framing AI governance as a leadership problem risks reproducing the same category error examined earlier. Techniques optimized for intra-protocol environments—where authority is clear and interpretation can be disciplined—are applied to systems whose behavior is already shaped by environmental and infrastructural constraints. The result is a form of control theater: highly visible managerial action with limited causal leverage.</p><p>The alternative suggested by protocol theory is ecological rather than heroic. Effective management in AI-mediated environments depends less on directing agents and more on shaping the conditions under which behavior hardens. Three considerations become central. First is the <strong>rate of hardening</strong>: how quickly repeated behaviors become embedded as defaults or automated decisions. Second is <strong>reversibility</strong>: the extent to which emerging protocols can be rolled back or modified without systemic disruption. Third is <strong>invisibility</strong>: the point at which coordination has receded so far into infrastructure that intervention becomes difficult or illegible. Managing these dimensions requires restraint as much as action, and design choices that preserve optionality rather than maximize short-term efficiency.</p><p>This perspective resolves the apparent tension between <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> and <em>New Nature</em> without diminishing either. <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> is precise, local, and exceptionally well-suited to the environment it addresses. It demonstrates how leadership can be exercised effectively within a stable protocol boundary under extreme conditions. Its limitation is ecological: the assumptions that make it work do not generalize to open, networked systems where protocols emerge and interact beyond any single locus of control.</p><p>The broader lesson is that many traditional domains were bounded. Today’s leadership frameworks excel at solving intra-protocol problems—how actors operate within explicit, enforced systems. Protocolization, by contrast, generates extra-protocol challenges: how coordination hardens, spreads, and disappears from view across interconnected environments. Addressing these challenges requires a different managerial posture, one oriented toward stewardship rather than command.</p><p>Some systems require captains. Others require gardeners. In protocolized environments, responsible management increasingly consists of knowing when not to intervene, when to preserve slack, and when to allow coordination to stabilize on its own terms.</p>
