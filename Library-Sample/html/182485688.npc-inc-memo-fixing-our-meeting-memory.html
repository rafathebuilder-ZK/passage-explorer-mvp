<p>Team,</p><p>I want to talk about something that looks small on the surface but compounds fast if left unattended.</p><p>Since our inception last month, <strong>we’ve seen people opting out of meetings, limiting participation, or moving important conversations “off the record.”</strong> We’ve also seen a sharp decline in meeting minutes and shared write-ups. At the same time, our internal agents, temporarily absent teammates, and models are increasingly missing context—especially why decisions were made.</p><p>These are not separate issues. They are the same issue.</p><p>After review, the root cause is straightforward: <strong>uncertainty about recording. </strong>I empathise, I’ve turned down recording myself multiple times.</p><p>When people don’t know how our words will be captured, summarized, reused, or interpreted later, they behave rationally. We speak less. We hedge. Or we avoid the meeting on official channels and start a Signal chat. That behavior is understandable—but it’s not compatible with a company that wants to think clearly and move quickly.</p><p><strong>We need candid, exploratory conversations AND, we need durable institutional memory.</strong></p><p>If those two are in tension, we’re using the wrong tools.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Shared Beliefs:</strong></h3><ul><li><p>We assume all meetings are recorded by default—that’s already becoming a given, even in person as people increasingly have AI assistants.</p></li><li><p>All of us should have agency over the resolution at which our words are remembered. </p></li><li><p>All of us have the right to remember our own words.</p></li><li><p>We don’t have control over the propagation of our words once recorded.</p></li></ul><p>In short, we should have a say in what is remembered, summarized, and reused. If we get this right, we get better meetings and better memory.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>What is Goldfish?</strong></h3><p><strong>Today, we’re rolling out Goldfish company-wide.</strong></p><p>Goldfish is built by an ambitious and privacy-centric team called Resolution Co. Their mission is to ensure privacy is an interoperable protocol across aware hardware and software. They are working with leading organizations to integrate their protocol and open-source code.</p><p>Their Goldfish product is infrastructure that governs meeting memory. It doesn’t judge content and it doesn’t manage intelligence. It enforces clear, shared rules about how conversation turns into memory. Most AI assistant wearables already acknowledge Goldfish preference settings, both personal and corporate.</p><p>What this means in practice:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Personal defaults:</strong> You can set a default resolution for how your contributions are remembered—how quotable, attributable, and persistent they are.</p></li><li><p><strong>Company defaults: </strong>We will be setting a minimum resolution of task lists and summary decision rationale for all meetings. This is a legal requirement. There will be no required quotes or attributions. Meeting memory will also have an expiry date of 1-year to comply with data retention policy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Explicit checks:</strong> At the start and end of meetings, Goldfish confirms the agreed resolution so expectations are shared, not assumed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-time dynamic adjustments:</strong> If someone says “this is off the record” or “don’t quote me on this,” Goldfish treats that as a resolution change and enforces it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Individual right to remember:</strong> After a meeting, you can choose to retain a higher-resolution record of your own contributions—without changing how others’ contributions are stored or shared.</p></li></ul><p>We believe Goldfish will make meeting memories more useful, and respectful, so we can be honest and thorough - but also remember.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Why this matters</strong></h3><p>It might be tempting to think that meeting minutes are just bureaucracy. In reality, they are how organizations scale thinking over time.</p><p>They help us:</p><ul><li><p>bring new or absent teammates up to speed,</p></li><li><p>make our internal agents genuinely helpful,</p></li><li><p>avoid re-visiting decisions,</p></li><li><p>and understand the reasoning behind our choices months later.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h3><strong>What happens next</strong></h3><p>Goldfish has been enabled across our meeting tools as of this morning. You’ll receive an automated Slack message, in a custom Goldfish channel, which will include guidance on setting your defaults and what to expect during meetings.</p><p>Use it. Stress it. Give feedback (either DM Alice or simply share directly via your Goldfish channel with your default resolution).</p><p>If we do this well, meetings become better places to think, and memory becomes something that works for us instead of against us.</p><p><br>Warm regards,</p><p><em>CEO, NPC Inc.</em></p>
