<p><strong>COASE CONTEXT</strong></p><p>Economic theory has traditionally described the coordination of economic activity as the outcome of market exchange. In this account, prices summarize relevant information, guide the allocation of resources, and reconcile individual plans without the need for centralized direction. Production decisions are made by independent actors responding to relative prices; adjustments occur through substitution at the margin; and order emerges as an unintended consequence of decentralized choice. This description has proven analytically powerful and, within its domain of applicability, broadly accurate.</p><p>Yet, as Coase observed, this description is incomplete. A substantial portion of economic activity takes place outside the price mechanism, within firms. Within these domains, resource allocation is not continuously renegotiated through contracts or prices. Instead, actions are coordinated by direction, planning, and internal rules. The question Coase posed was not why markets exist, but why they are supplemented by firms at all. Any contemporary account of the firm must begin from the same point of tension: if markets coordinate so effectively, why are they not used universally?</p><p>In the classical model, <strong>coordination among independent actors is achieved through what can be termed </strong><em><strong>transaction protocols</strong></em><strong>.</strong> </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>I. TRANSACTION PROTOCOLS</strong></p><p>These protocols specify how commitments are formed, priced, and settled. Contracts define obligations; auctions and bargaining procedures determine terms; settlement mechanisms specify when obligations are discharged; and price discovery aggregates dispersed information into actionable signals. The theoretical appeal of this system lies in its generality. Given well-defined property rights and negligible costs of contracting, any desired allocation can, in principle, be achieved through exchange.</p><p>Transaction protocols function by stabilizing commitment under conditions of independence. Actors need not share authority, goals, or internal organization. It is sufficient that they recognize the validity of the protocol and accept its outcomes as binding. <strong>Prices, contracts, and settlement rules substitute for trust or command.</strong> In the limit case assumed by much of neoclassical theory, these protocols are frictionless. Information is available, negotiation is costless, and enforcement is automatic.</p><p>However, as Coase emphasized, this limit case does not describe economic reality. The use of transaction protocols entails costs: discovering relevant prices, negotiating and specifying contracts, monitoring performance, and enforcing obligations. These costs are not incidental; they grow with the complexity, frequency, and interdependence of the actions to be coordinated. When coordination requires continuous adjustment, when contingencies cannot be exhaustively specified ex ante, or when performance is difficult to verify, reliance on repeated market transactions becomes increasingly burdensome.</p><p><strong>It is at this point that the firm appears as a substitute for specific uses of transaction protocols.</strong> The firm replaces a series of market transactions with an internal arrangement in which certain decisions are removed from continuous bargaining and placed under authority. Coase characterized this shift as the substitution of direction for price. What matters for present purposes is that this substitution is not arbitrary; it is motivated by comparative costs. Firms arise where the cost of coordinating through transaction protocols exceeds the cost of coordinating through internal organization.</p><p>To reinterpret this argument in more explicit terms, authority within the firm can be understood as a distinct protocol regime. <strong>Rather than coordinating independent actors through prices and contracts, the firm coordinates </strong><em><strong>production protocols</strong></em><strong> through </strong><em><strong>management protocols </strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>II. MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS</strong></p><p>These protocols operate within a shared authority boundary and stabilize a different form of uncertainty. Where transaction protocols stabilize commitment among independent actors, management protocols stabilize legitimacy, coherence, and accountability among actors who are formally related.</p><p>Management protocols specify who may act, under what conditions, and with what consequences. Role-based access controls, approval rules, accounting standards, planning systems, and incident response procedures are all instances of such protocols. They do not merely allocate tasks; they define what counts as an authorized action, how actions are to be interpreted, and how responsibility is assigned. Importantly, they also provide mechanisms for handling exceptions and failures without renegotiating fundamental relationships.</p><p>This interpretation refines, rather than departs from, Coase’s insight. Authority is not simply hierarchy in a sociological sense; it is a protocolized replacement for repeated contracting. By entering into an employment relationship, an actor agrees in advance to accept a range of directives whose specific content will be determined later. This agreement reduces the need for continuous specification and negotiation. The cost savings arise not from eliminating coordination, but from stabilizing it under a different set of rules.</p><p>It is necessary, however, to distinguish management protocols from a third category that Coase did not explicitly theorize but which is essential to contemporary firms: <em><strong>production protocols</strong></em><strong>.</strong> </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>III. PRODUCTION PROTOCOLS</strong></p><p><strong>Production protocols stabilize the transformation of inputs into outputs.</strong> They specify sequences of operations, quality criteria, inspection regimes, and maintenance rules. Inventory control systems, manufacturing standards, continuous integration and deployment pipelines, and testing procedures all belong to this class. Their function is to reduce variability in execution, ensuring that given inputs reliably yield expected outputs.</p><p>This distinction is analytically important. Management protocols and production protocols address different uncertainties. Management protocols stabilize normative uncertainty: uncertainty about what actions are permitted, how they will be evaluated, and how the organization will respond to deviations. Production protocols stabilize causal uncertainty: uncertainty about whether a given set of actions will, in fact, produce the intended result. Although both operate within firms and are often intertwined in practice, they are not interchangeable. Management protocols authorize and contextualize action; production protocols execute it.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>THE FIRM REVISITED: A PROTOCOL SYSTEM</strong></p><p>With this distinction in place, the boundary of the firm can be described more precisely. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>A firm encompasses those activities for which coordination through management and production protocols is less costly than coordination through transaction protocols.</strong></em> </p></blockquote><p>Where the costs of specifying, pricing, and enforcing market contracts are high relative to the costs of internal direction and execution, activities are internalized. Where the reverse holds, activities are left to the market.</p><p>This account also clarifies why firm boundaries are neither fixed nor uniform. Different activities exhibit different combinations of commitment, coherence, and execution uncertainty. As technologies, legal frameworks, and organizational capabilities change, the relative costs of protocol regimes change as well. The expansion or contraction of firms reflects shifts in these comparative costs, not a universal tendency toward integration or disintegration.</p><p>Modern firms make this logic more visible. Contemporary organizations rarely rely on a single coordination mechanism. Instead, they assemble <em>protocol stacks</em> that combine transaction, management, and production protocols in layered arrangements. Procurement may be governed by market-based contracts; internal budgeting by management rules; and software delivery by automated production pipelines. Even within a single activity, different protocol regimes may coexist. External vendors may be coordinated through contracts, internal teams through authority, and machines through execution scripts.</p><p>This layered structure also explains why organizational and technical architectures tend to align. Management protocols require enforcement points: places where permissions are checked, approvals recorded, and responsibilities logged. These enforcement points are often implemented as interfaces in technical systems. Over time, such interfaces harden into architectural boundaries. The resulting systems reflect, in their structure, the underlying coordination choices of the organization. This phenomenon, often described as a mirroring between organizational communication and system design, follows directly from the need to operationalize management protocols.</p><p>None of these observations overturn Coase’s original argument. Rather, they extend it by differentiating the internal mechanisms of firms more carefully and by recognizing that coordination costs now arise not only in markets, but within increasingly complex organizations. The firm remains a response to the costs of using the price mechanism, but the nature of that response has diversified. Authority is exercised through formalized protocols; execution is stabilized through automation; and boundaries are continuously renegotiated as protocol costs shift.</p><p>This account does not imply that firms will converge on a single optimal form, nor that markets or hierarchies will dominate. It suggests instead that economic organization is best understood as a problem of protocol selection and combination. The relevant question is not whether an activity should be performed by a firm or a market in the abstract, but which protocol regime is best suited to stabilize the dominant uncertainties involved. The answer to that question will remain contingent, partial, and subject to revision as coordination technologies evolve.</p>
