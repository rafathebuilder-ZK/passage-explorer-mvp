<p><em>Contemporary management no longer operates primarily through supervision, leadership, or episodic decision-making. Instead, it unfolds as the continuous governance of interdependent commitments in systems where action is increasingly executed—or refused—by software-mediated protocols. Drawing on concrete cases from version control systems, multisignature authorization, enterprise workflows, and platform governance, this essay argues that management today stabilizes action under persistent tension by embedding constraints into executable procedures, and adapts through a sensemaking apparatus that interprets signals and legitimizes change. Rather than proposing a new “best practice,” the paper reframes management as an ongoing coordination problem shaped by law, markets, norms, and architecture—and shows why managerial work now concentrates on protocol design, exception handling, and interpretation rather than command.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://npcmemo.substack.com/p/most-management-today-isnt-leadership?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://npcmemo.substack.com/p/most-management-today-isnt-leadership?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>A manager today can spend a morning in three discussions, whether chats or meeting rooms with diverse architectures, and yet each discussion insists on the same kind of accountability. In the first discussion, a treasury transfer sits in a queue inside a multisignature wallet. The transaction is innocuous in intent—paying an invoice, moving funds to a new custody arrangement—but it will not move until a threshold of signers confirms it. In the second discussion, a change waits in a version control system such as Git. The code is similarly innocuous—an update to a configuration file, a patch, a dependency bump—but the protected branch will refuse it until the right reviews and checks have passed. Git does not care about the author’s confidence; the branch protection rule cares about its own conditions. GitHub makes this explicit: protected branches can require reviews, forbid force pushes, and require passing status checks before changes land.<a href="https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>In the third discussion, an ERP workflow routes a purchase order or a journal entry through a sequence of approvals, generating an audit trail as it goes, because the organization must later prove that authorization occurred as represented. Oracle’s approval framework describes this bluntly: it produces an audit trail for each approval transaction as the transaction passes through the approval process.<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/F13810_02/hcm92pbr29/eng/hcm/hhaf/task_GeneratinganApprovalsAuditReport-0f6e77.html?pli=ul_d45e375_hhaf&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>In each discussion, the manager’s presence is secondary. Coordination is carried by procedures that either allow the next step or refuse it. The manager, previously a core conduit of the decision itself, has mutated: The manager must live <em>within</em> the system’s decisions without mistaking them for mere friction, because system approvals and refusals now encode the organization’s theory of responsibility.</p><p>This is an awkward starting point if one’s vocabulary for management still centers on supervision, motivation, or leadership. The manager in these discussions is not primarily inspiring anyone, and often not making decisions either. Instead, the manager is observing how obligations propagate through systems that have their own guardrails, their own latency, their own failure modes, and their own claims to legitimacy. At the same time, they are orienting their relevant team regarding the systems and their design. The situation is easier to recognize than to name: work is interdependent, change is continuous, constraints are multiple and often conflicting, and the right to act is increasingly conditional. The lived texture is that commitments do not become action simply because someone wants them to. They become action by passing through sequences of authorization, verification, and record-making that must satisfy law, internal norms, market pressure, and technical architecture at once. One might say that these sequences, of varying hardness, are management itself.</p><p>If management is approached as a set of traits or a style, discussions regarding system approvals and controls look like bureaucratic overgrowth on top of real work. Instead, if management is approached as coordination under complex constraints, the discussions begin to look like work. I would posit that the central hazard in contemporary organizations is not a shortage of initiative. It is the compounding risk of coordination failure due to its complex computing systems: obligations that cannot be executed because dependencies are misaligned; changes executed too quickly and break production; expenditures that cannot be justified later; controls that exist on paper and fail under pressure; decisions that are taken in one forum and contested in another. The organization is forced to act while unable to settle, once and for all, what “the right action” would mean across all stakeholders and time horizons. That is the more basic condition: interdependence combined with ongoing change inside a field of constraints that do not harmonize themselves.</p><p>A useful way to regain causal grip is to shift attention away from managers as people and toward what organizations actually manipulate when they “manage.” Organizations act through commitments, authoritative obligation to deliver an outcome under specified conditions: an invoice to pay, a release to ship, a control to enforce, a service to restore, a moderation decision to apply. Commitments differ from intentions in that they generate enforceable expectations. They create dependencies, possibilities of being blamed, and auditable futures. However, they are not purely contractual, though contracts are a major species. A commit in Git is not a legal commitment, yet in a production environment it functions as one: it claims, “this is the state we are willing to run,” and it must be reviewed and merged under agreed conditions. A multisig transaction proposal claims, “this spend is authorized,” and it will either be executed by the protocol or remain inert. An ERP approval claims, “this purchase was approved through the proper sequence,” and the audit trail becomes a durable witness. In today’s organizations, the manager’s work consists less in producing or coordinating effort and more in governing which commitments exist, which commitments are prioritized, which commitments are allowed to bind the organization, and which commitments are revoked or revised when reality changes.</p><p>This governance is never performed in a vacuum. Commitments are made under persistent tensions. Tensions, here, are not dilemmas or trilemmas that disappear with better values, better tooling, or better communication; they are permanent structural tradeoffs generated by competing constraints and objectives. Speed presses against safety. Autonomy presses against coherence. Efficiency presses against thoroughness. Innovation presses against reliability. And although the horizon of trade-offs may be pushed outward, the manager is not solving these tensions so much as keeping the organization coherent while living inside them. Each mechanism that stabilizes one side tends to irritate the other. Tight controls reduce fraud risk, but at the expense increase cycle time. A feed-ranking change that claims to promote well-being also reshapes an entire market of publishers, advertisers, and creators who depended on the previous allocation of attention. Meta’s 2018 “Bringing People Closer Together” update made this tension explicit in its own terms, describing ranking changes that would prioritize “meaningful” interactions and shift what users see.<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>The organization cannot honor all constraints simultaneously, and yet it must act. Management, in this frame, is the work of making action possible without pretending the tensions have been dissolved.</p><p>How does action become possible when tensions persist? Through protocols. A protocol is a formalized coordination procedure that makes commitments executable under constraints. It sequences actions and decision points, allocates authority, embeds requirements, and produces records that others can rely on. Protocols are the organization’s provisional settlements with its own tensions; the choice of protocol is the choice of programmatic trade-offs. They must privilege some constraints over others for a time, in a way that can be executed repeatedly by many actors who do not share context, trust, or interpretation. For example, branch protection rules are protocols for stabilizing code change. They decide which changes may land, under which checks, with which approvals, and with which safeguards against destructive actions like force pushes. GitHub documents this as a way to “enforce certain workflows” such as requiring approving reviews and passing status checks before merging into protected branches.<a href="https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>Similarly, multisig schemes are protocols for stabilizing high-value authorization. A Safe smart contract wallet, for example, enforces a confirmation threshold: a transaction will not execute until the required number of owners approves. Modules extend that wallet with additional logic and can be added or removed only with confirmation from the required threshold of owners, with events emitted as part of the record of change.<a href="https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>In an additional example, ERP approval workflows encode protocols for stabilizing spend and financial reporting. They route transactions through approval steps and maintain audit trails as those transactions pass through the process.<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/F13810_02/hcm92pbr29/eng/hcm/hhaf/task_GeneratinganApprovalsAuditReport-0f6e77.html?pli=ul_d45e375_hhaf&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>No protocols are neutral. They inscribe decisions about what kinds of errors and abuses matter most, which delays are tolerable, which actors are trusted, and which records will count as evidence later. They are also revisable artifacts, drift, accumulate exceptions, and can become theater. Their revision is itself a kind of management work, often more consequential than any single decision inside them.</p><p><strong>What distinguishes this configuration from management as it was even a decade ago is not the presence of rules, procedures, or bureaucracy, but the degree to which coordination has become continuously executable, externally visible, and non-discretionary by default. </strong>Ten years ago, many managerial controls still operated as representations: policies described expectations, approvals were logged after the fact, and deviations were often corrected through supervision or escalation. Today, an increasing share of coordination is enforced <em>in advance</em> by software-mediated protocols that refuse action outright unless conditions are met. A deployment does not merely violate policy; it fails to merge. A transfer does not require later justification; it does not execute. A purchase does not become non-compliant; it never posts. This shift matters because it relocates managerial work from supervising execution to designing, maintaining, and revising the conditions under which execution is possible at all. As a result, management is less episodic and corrective, and more continuous and architectural: the organization is governed not primarily through interventions after breakdown, but through the ongoing calibration of protocols that bind commitments across systems, teams, and institutional boundaries.</p><p>At this point, it can be tempting to treat protocols as the entire story: management has been distilled into the design and enforcement of procedures, with software as the primary medium that executes those procedures with increasing strictness. That temptation underestimates what happens after execution produces outcomes. Outcomes are signals, and signals do not arrive pre-interpreted. A production incident occurs and the logs, metrics, and timelines proliferate; the question becomes what the incident means and what the organization is now authorized to change. A control is followed and the auditors still find a material weakness; the question becomes whether the organization’s claims to control match what the controls actually do. A feed-ranking change rolls out and engagement shifts; the question becomes which effects count as intended improvements and which effects count as unacceptable externalities. The organization requires machinery that converts signals into shared interpretations and legitimate changes. That machinery is a sensemaking apparatus, the necessary complement to protocols, which relies on protocols itself but is distinct from them.</p><p>A sensemaking apparatus is the ensemble of mechanisms an organization uses to orient itself. It interprets signals, aligns meaning across actors, justifies decisions, and authorizes coordinated change. It includes dashboards, postmortems, retrospectives, audits, escalation paths, decision rationales, and the forums where responsibility is assigned and revision is permitted. Its function is not to guarantee truth. Its function is to make action legitimate under uncertainty. This distinction matters because contemporary organizations often possess abundant data and insufficient agreement. Meaning is constructed; legitimacy is allocated; the right to act is negotiated. When a protocol fails, the next move is rarely to discard it. The next move is to interpret whether it failed in the way the organization is willing to recognize, and whether revising it will violate a different constraint that matters more.</p><p>A concrete case shows how these elements braid together: the 2022 Ronin bridge compromise associated with the Axie Infinity ecosystem. During this incident, a significant amount of assets were stolen. Public reporting describes attackers obtaining enough validator keys to meet the threshold required for withdrawals—five out of nine validators—making the system’s own authorization protocol the vehicle for theft.<a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-ronin-hack-march-2022?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>What makes this case analytically useful is not the spectacle of the dollar amount. It is the way a commitment becomes executable inside a protocol whose constraints are simultaneously technical, economic, normative, and institutional. The commitment, in the simplest form, is a withdrawal authorization: release assets from a bridge contract. The protocol is the validator threshold: a multisignature-like requirement that a minimum set of validators sign to approve withdrawals. The architectural constraint is the private key as a bearer instrument: whoever holds the key can sign, and the system treats the signature as authority. The market constraint is obvious: the bridge holds large reserves, and the incentive to attack grows with the reserve size. The normative constraint is trust and governance: who gets to be a validator, how keys are protected, how exceptional access is granted in the name of operational speed. Reports around Ronin highlight compromised keys and the role of social engineering rather than a purely on-chain exploit, which is precisely a breach at the seam between protocol and practice: the protocol was followed, yet the outcome violated the organization’s intent.</p><p>This is where the tension structure becomes visible. Security presses against operability. A validator set that is large and geographically distributed lowers key-compromise risk and increases coordination cost and operational latency. A validator set that is smaller and operationally centralized increases speed and reduces coordination burden while increasing systemic risk. The protocol is a provisional settlement: five-of-nine is a choice about how much security the organization is buying with how much friction. In normal times, the protocol stabilizes action; in attack conditions, the protocol becomes brittle because it cannot distinguish a legitimate signature from a coerced or stolen one. The sensemaking apparatus enters after the fact. There are incident reports, forensic narratives, stakeholder communications, regulator attention, user outrage, and internal accountability. A decision must be reached about what counts as the failure: insufficient decentralization, insufficient key management, insufficient monitoring, incentives that encouraged speed, governance arrangements that normalized exceptional access. The reporting on the bridge hacks emphasizes, in Ronin’s case, the threat of compromised private keys and social engineering in a setting where oversight and monitoring were weak relative to the value at risk.<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-network-bridge-hacks?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>The legitimacy problem becomes acute because the system technically did what it was designed to do—accept signatures—while failing at what the organization claimed the system was for—secure asset transfer. The organization must re-authorize change under scrutiny, which forces protocol revision and governance revision in full view of markets and publics.</p><p>If the Ronin case shows a protocol whose authority exceeded its practice, ERP cases show the inverse: practice is frequently held hostage by legitimacy demands that arrive as law and audit. The Sarbanes-Oxley regime is a canonical example because it formalizes, at the institutional level, the claim that internal control over financial reporting must be assessed and reported. The SEC’s rules and releases around internal control over financial reporting make plain that issuers are subject to Section 404(a) requirements and must include management’s report on internal control in the annual report.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2010/33-9142.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>The PCAOB’s AS 2201 establishes requirements when an auditor is engaged to audit management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, integrated with the audit of financial statements.<a href="https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/auditing-standards/details/AS2201?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>This legal-institutional frame produces commitments that are managerial in a strict sense: the organization must be able to demonstrate that certain transactions cannot be initiated, approved, and recorded by a single individual without detection; the organization must be able to evidence approvals, changes, and access decisions as part of an audit trail.</p><p>Here the protocol is not a mere workflow convenience. It is a defensible coordination mechanism. Segregation of duties functions as a constraint that forces a tension: efficiency presses against control. SAP’s own documentation describes segregation of duties as designed to minimize the risk of fraud and errors and protect assets such as data or inventories. Approval workflows in ERP systems route actions through roles and thresholds; audit trails make the route legible later. Oracle’s approvals audit reporting describes an audit trail that tracks approval transactions and distinguishes actions by an original approver and a proxy, which is the kind of detail that exists because legitimacy is contested in practice.<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/F13810_02/hcm92pbr29/eng/hcm/hhaf/task_GeneratinganApprovalsAuditReport-0f6e77.html?pli=ul_d45e375_hhaf&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>The manager working inside this regime experiences the same phenomenon as the manager working inside GitHub protections or Safe thresholds: commitments are gated by protocols. A purchase cannot proceed until the right approver has approved. Yet the sensemaking apparatus remains necessary because evidence can exist without meaning. An audit finding can reveal that controls were bypassed through emergency access, that roles were misconfigured, that approval thresholds were too permissive for certain transaction classes. The organization must decide whether to tighten protocols, accept new delays, redesign processes, or redefine what counts as acceptable risk.</p><p>The version control discussion highlights the daily banality of these dynamics, which is why it is a useful case to observe management practices when stakes are smaller than bridge reserves or financial statements. Git workflows turn code change into a stream of commitments: each change asserts a new reality. Protected branches and required reviews embed constraints into the path by which these commitments become executable in production. GitHub’s documentation treats this as governance: branch protection rules define whether collaborators can delete or force push, and can require status checks or reviews before merging.<a href="https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>Code owners add a normative layer that becomes procedural: the organization declares that certain people must review changes in certain parts of the codebase, formalizing “who gets to say yes” in a way that is legible and enforceable through the protocol.<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/about-code-owners?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>The tension is stable: speed presses against reliability; developer autonomy presses against system integrity. The protocol is a settlement: it formalizes, often slowing, the path to production to buy confidence and accountability, while still enabling scale in contribution. The sensemaking apparatus is the suite of pull request discussions, incident reviews, and postmortems that interpret whether the settlement is still adequate. A build failure can be interpreted as a useful check or as a nuisance that trains people to ignore red signals. A review process can be interpreted as quality assurance or as gatekeeping. The same protocol can stabilize order or produce resentment and workarounds depending on whether the sensemaking apparatus maintains legitimacy.</p><p>Social media feed ranking makes the legitimacy dimension unavoidable because the “organization” is an ecosystem and the protocol is an algorithmic curation regime that allocates attention. When Facebook announced changes to News Feed ranking in 2018, it framed the change as prioritizing posts that lead to “meaningful” interactions and shifting what users see from friends and family versus public content.<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>The commitment here is distributed: to users, to advertisers, to publishers, to regulators, to internal safety teams. The protocol is partly code, partly policy, partly enforcement practice. The market constraint is that attention is scarce and monetized. The normative constraint is that the platform is judged for effects on well-being, misinformation, polarization. The legal constraint is ongoing and jurisdictional, including content moderation obligations and consumer protection regimes. The sensemaking apparatus includes metrics, content audits, public communications, and the internal deliberations over what counts as meaningful interaction versus engagement bait. The point is not that one change was good or bad. The point is that management in such systems is the governance of interdependent commitments under persistent tension, enacted through protocols whose changes must be justified as legitimate to multiple audiences.</p><p>These cases converge on a causal sequence that is simple enough to say and difficult enough to live. Constraints arrive from law, markets, norms, and architecture. Commitments are made within those constraints. Protocols stabilize execution by embedding constraints into repeatable procedures. Execution produces signals whose meaning is uncertain and contested. A sensemaking apparatus interprets signals, allocates responsibility, and authorizes change. Commitments and protocols are revised. The loop continues. It is uneven and political because constraints do not align and because authority is distributed across roles, systems, and institutional stakeholders. The loop is continuous because change is continuous: new vulnerabilities, new regulations, new dependencies, new market conditions, new forms of abuse. Even a stable protocol becomes unstable as its environment changes.</p><p>Now, the temptation emerges to declare a replacement theory of management: management becomes protocol design plus sensemaking governance, and everything else becomes residual. That move overclaims, and it misses where practice pushes back. Protocols can become brittle. In the Safe ecosystem, the power of modules is a known example of how extensibility creates risk. OpenZeppelin’s discussion of backdooring multisig wallets stresses that modules can have more power than owners and can act as attacker-controlled backdoors, and that modules should not be added without security review.<a href="https://www.openzeppelin.com/news/backdooring-gnosis-safe-multisig-wallets?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a>The protocol that was intended to increase flexibility can widen the attack surface. A protocol can become symbolic: approvals are “done” because a workflow says so, while real discretion moves elsewhere through informal channels. Sensemaking apparatus can become theater: dashboards proliferate and decisions remain unchanged because the forums exist to produce closure rather than learning. Metrics can be gamed. Postmortems can become ritual blame allocations. Branch protections can lead to rubber-stamp reviewing. Approval workflows can lead to proxy approvals that preserve the appearance of segregation while reintroducing the same concentration of power through delegation.</p><p>Power dynamics shape both protocol design and interpretation, even when the language is technical. Who can approve exceptions, who owns the keys, who is a code owner, who can change the branch rules, who can modify ERP roles, who has standing in an incident review—these are governance decisions. The systems make them executable, which makes them more consequential. A manager in this environment spends a significant portion of time tending to the seams: handling exceptions, negotiating legitimacy, repairing trust after failures, and deciding when to tighten protocols versus when to loosen them to maintain throughput. The scarcest resource is rarely information. It is time and attention that can be coherently coordinated across interdependent actors. The cost of maintaining protocols and sensemaking apparatus is not only cognitive. It is political and economic: slowed releases, delayed payments, lost opportunities, frustrated teams, compliance overhead, and sometimes the opposite risk, where excessive speed creates catastrophic failure.</p><p>This is why the definition of contemporary management must remain bounded. The argument so far fits best in interdependent, constraint-heavy settings where change is frequent and the consequences of coordination failure are meaningful: software production and operations, regulated finance, complex supply networks, platform governance, decentralized asset custody. It fits less well in settings where commitments are simple, interdependence is low, and legitimacy is primarily local and informal. It also fits less well as a total account of motivation, identity, and meaning in organizations, which remain central and yet do not fully explain the coordination mechanics that dominate the manager’s day in the rooms described at the beginning.</p><p>Still, a disciplined definition emerges as an empirical summary rather than a slogan. <strong>Contemporary management is the continuous governance of interdependent commitments in networked, often software-mediated production systems operating under persistent tensions.</strong> It stabilizes action through protocols that embed constraints into executable coordination, and it adapts through a sensemaking apparatus that interprets signals, arbitrates meaning, and authorizes legitimate change. This definition does not elevate protocols into destiny. It treats protocols as provisional settlements that must be maintained, revised, and sometimes distrusted. It does not treat sensemaking as enlightenment. It treats sensemaking as the machinery by which organizations make coordination possible under uncertainty and scrutiny. It places the manager’s work where it is increasingly lived: inside systems that refuse action until conditions are met, and inside forums where the meaning of outcomes is negotiated so that the next revision can be justified.</p><p>Restoring proportion at the end requires saying what this framing buys and what it costs. It buys causal clarity about why management persists even in organizations full of competent people: commitments generate dependencies; tensions persist; protocols stabilize; interpretation legitimizes change; the loop continues. It buys a way to talk about software subsumption without treating it as a takeover: software increasingly executes protocols, which shifts managerial effort toward protocol design, exception handling, and sensemaking governance. It costs some psychological richness because it privileges coordination mechanics over interior motives. It costs some moral clarity because legitimacy is treated as a practical constraint and a contested resource rather than a stable good. It also costs universality because the theory is scoped to contemporary interdependent systems rather than asserted as timeless. Those costs are tolerable if the result is a vocabulary that matches what managers actually inhabit: obligations gated by procedures, action constrained by architecture, scrutiny imposed by law and markets, norms that change the meaning of the same data, and the permanent tension of needing to act while unable to settle, once and for all, what acting correctly would mean.</p>
