<p>This thesis develops a comprehensive account of economic power in digitally mediated markets by unifying and extending Ben Thompson’s Aggregation Theory and contrasting it with an original framework for understanding protocol power. Aggregation Theory is reconstructed in full, incorporating its major revisions over time, including the distinctions between distribution and transaction control, the role of hardware and operating system layers, the logic of commoditizing complements, the typology of attention, transaction, and platform aggregators, the recognition that aggregators expand total addressable markets, the constraints created by infrastructural entrenchment, and the emergence of AI-based epistemic aggregation. The resulting mature theory positions aggregators as firms that capture demand-side market power under conditions of zero marginal cost distribution and multi-sided network effects.</p><p>In parallel, the thesis identifies a conceptual blind spot within Aggregation Theory: <strong>while aggregators appropriate surplus, protocols define the feasible coordination environment in which aggregation occurs.</strong> A theory of protocol power is proposed to fill this gap. Protocols—whether internet standards or blockchain consensus systems—exert structural influence by establishing the rules, constraints, and affordances that shape interoperability, switching costs, data flows, and the strategic options available to firms. Unlike aggregators, protocols do not “own” user relationships and do not directly capture surplus; instead, they wield constitutional power over the economic landscape.</p><p>Finally, the thesis analyzes how large language models alter both forms of power. LLMs function as epistemic aggregators, intermediating not only transactions but cognition itself, while simultaneously obscuring underlying protocols and introducing new quasi-protocol substrates through model-mediated interaction. Together, these dynamics suggest an evolving equilibrium in which aggregators, protocols, and AI systems jointly define the structure of digital market power. This framework offers a unified lens for analyzing contemporary platform dynamics, governance debates, and the future architecture of digital economies.</p><h1><strong>SECTION I — Aggregation Theory: A Fully Comprehensive Logical Argument</strong></h1><h2><strong>I. Introduction and Statement of Purpose</strong></h2><p>This section presents a formal, comprehensive articulation of Aggregation Theory as developed, expanded, and corrected by Ben Thompson over the past decade. The goal is to produce a logically coherent theory of digital-era firm power that integrates all major revisions to Thompson’s framework, including his analyses of vertical integration, hardware and OS control, distribution versus transaction control, commoditizing complements, market expansion effects, the aggregator’s dilemma, and AI-era aggregation.</p><p>The argument aims to stand independently as a complete account of Aggregation Theory in its mature 2024 form, which Thompson describes implicitly as a <strong>general theory of power under digital distribution conditions</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>II. Foundations: Digital Distribution and Economic Preconditions</strong></h2><p><strong>Premise 1: The digitization of distribution collapses marginal costs.</strong><br>Digital distribution technologies reduce the incremental cost of serving an additional user to effectively zero. Once the fixed cost of creating the software platform or service is paid, scale is unconstrained by either physical production or logistical bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>Premise 2: Consumers face increased abundance and limited attention.</strong><br>As distribution friction declines, the quantity of available supply expands dramatically. Consumers become overwhelmed by choice and seek reliable, convenient interfaces to manage search, relevance, and trust.</p><p><strong>Premise 3: Interfaces become economically significant when they mediate user choice.</strong><br>Entities capable of presenting, sorting, or filtering supply for users become critical coordination points. The locus of value begins to migrate from producers toward intermediaries capable of synthesizing abundance.</p><p><strong>Conclusion A:</strong><br>Digital distribution creates the structural conditions for demand-side concentration, in which the interface between users and supply becomes a potential site of persistent market power.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>III. The Core Mechanism: The Three Criteria of Aggregators</strong></h2><p>Thompson originally argued that digital-era “Aggregators” are defined by <strong>three interlocking characteristics</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>A direct relationship with end users</strong> – users choose the aggregator as their primary interface.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zero marginal costs for serving users</strong> – characteristic of software-based distribution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Demand-driven multi-sided networks</strong> – suppliers join because users are present, reinforcing the aggregator’s position.</p></li></ol><p>These three criteria can be restated as follows:</p><p><strong>Premise 4: Direct user relationships create control over demand.</strong><br>The aggregator does not rely on distributors or intermediaries to reach users. Its relationship is unmediated and therefore defensible.</p><p><strong>Premise 5: Zero marginal cost enables instantaneous scale.</strong><br>With negligible cost to serve additional users, aggregators can expand rapidly and asymmetrically, outpacing firms burdened by incremental cost.</p><p><strong>Premise 6: Multi-sided network effects strengthen with scale.</strong><br>Users attract suppliers, whose presence increases the platform’s value to users, triggering self-reinforcing growth.</p><p><strong>Conclusion B:</strong><br>Any firm satisfying these three criteria will tend, under competitive conditions, to consolidate demand and achieve durable dominance.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>IV. The Dynamics of Aggregation: Control, Commoditization, and Surplus Capture</strong></h2><p>Aggregation Theory predicts that, once established, an aggregator will produce predictable downstream effects:</p><h3><strong>1. Control of Discovery and Selection</strong></h3><p><strong>Premise 7:</strong> When an aggregator becomes the dominant interface for users, it also becomes the default mechanism through which suppliers access demand.</p><p><strong>Premise 8:</strong> Because the aggregator mediates discovery, it can shape supplier visibility, pricing power, and competitive positioning.</p><h3><strong>2. Commoditization of Complements</strong></h3><p>Thompson’s later refinement emphasizes the principle that:</p><p><strong>Premise 9:</strong> Aggregators systematically reduce differentiation among suppliers because doing so reduces user switching costs and increases the aggregator’s own strategic power.</p><p>This is consistent with the broader economic logic that firms seek to <strong>commoditize complements</strong> to enhance their own bargaining position and revenue share.</p><h3><strong>3. Supplier Dependence and Bargaining Asymmetry</strong></h3><p><strong>Premise 10:</strong> Suppliers cannot opt out without losing access to concentrated demand. Their outside option becomes weak.</p><h3><strong>4. Surplus Capture</strong></h3><p><strong>Premise 11:</strong> Aggregators, positioned at the demand chokepoint, can extract a disproportionate share of industry surplus through advertising rents, take-rates, transaction fees, or subscription terms.</p><p><strong>Conclusion C:</strong><br>The aggregator’s dominance arises from structural interdependence: users depend on the aggregator for managing abundance; suppliers depend on the aggregator for access to users; the aggregator depends on neither.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>V. Corrections and Amendments: Thompson’s Evolving Framework</strong></h2><p>Over time, Thompson’s framework evolved, requiring incorporation of several major clarifications.</p><h3><strong>1. Layers and Non-linearity</strong></h3><p><strong>Premise 12:</strong> Aggregators do not necessarily occupy a single layer of the value chain. The early model assumed a clear supplier–aggregator–consumer stack, but real markets often involve multiple intermediaries, OS-level control, or hardware dependencies.</p><p><strong>Revision:</strong> Aggregation is not a layer classification but a <strong>power classification</strong>.</p><h3><strong>2. Distribution Control vs. Transaction Control</strong></h3><p>Thompson later distinguished between:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Distribution control:</strong> influencing what users see.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transaction control:</strong> controlling the terms under which users and suppliers transact.</p></li></ul><p>Some aggregators achieve both; some only one. The deeper power lies in <strong>controlling the end-to-end funnel from discovery to conversion.</strong></p><h3><strong>3. Types of Aggregators</strong></h3><p>Thompson identifies <strong>three distinct types</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Attention Aggregators</strong> – monetize through advertising.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transaction Aggregators</strong> – monetize through transactional fees.</p></li><li><p><strong>Platform Aggregators</strong> – control hardware or OS environments and charge rent on top.</p></li></ol><p>Each type exhibits the same underlying dynamics but differs in mechanism and monetization.</p><h3><strong>4. Market Expansion</strong></h3><p>Thompson corrected the initial assumption that aggregators simply reallocate surplus from suppliers. Instead:</p><p><strong>Premise 13:</strong> Aggregators often increase total market size by revealing latent demand and enabling new forms of consumption (e.g., micro-content, long-tail goods, global matching).</p><h3><strong>5. The Aggregator’s Dilemma</strong></h3><p>As aggregators become infrastructural:</p><ul><li><p>They attract regulatory scrutiny.</p></li><li><p>They may be required to standardize interfaces or enforce neutrality.</p></li><li><p>Their flexibility decreases as their responsibilities increase.</p></li></ul><p>This introduces a tension between <strong>user-centric optimization</strong> and <strong>institutional obligations</strong>, limiting strategic freedom.</p><h3><strong>6. AI Aggregation</strong></h3><p>With the rise of large language models:</p><p><strong>Premise 14:</strong> A new form of aggregation emerges at the model layer, where the system mediates not supply and demand but <strong>knowledge and inference</strong>.</p><p>AI models aggregate:</p><ul><li><p>Corpora of text, code, and data</p></li><li><p>User prompts and feedback</p></li><li><p>Interpretative heuristics</p></li></ul><p>They become <strong>epistemic interfaces</strong>, not merely functional ones.</p><p><strong>Conclusion D:</strong><br>Aggregation Theory now encompasses a broader category of demand intermediaries, including those that translate, synthesize, or generate content. The aggregator becomes a default interface to cognition, not merely a marketplace.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>VI. The Mature Theory (2024): Aggregation as the Modern Theory of Power</strong></h2><p>Synthesizing the preceding sections, the mature theory holds:</p><ol><li><p>Digital markets shift power from supply to demand.</p></li><li><p>Firms that control demand through direct user relationships and zero marginal cost scaling accumulate structural power.</p></li><li><p>This structural power enables them to commoditize suppliers and capture surplus.</p></li><li><p>Aggregator strategies vary by type (attention, transaction, platform) but share the same underlying logic.</p></li><li><p>As aggregators scale, they become infrastructural and face both regulatory and strategic constraints.</p></li><li><p>AI introduces a new form of aggregation where the aggregator no longer simply intermediates transactions but intermediates cognition itself.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Final Conclusion (Aggregators):</strong><br>Aggregation is the defining economic logic of digital markets. It is the modern theory of market power under conditions of abundant supply, negligible distribution costs, and user-centric value creation.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>SECTION II — Protocol Power: A Parallel but Distinct Framework</strong></h1><p>This section articulates a logically independent but complementary theory of <strong>protocol power</strong>, distinguishing it from aggregation.</p><h2><strong>I. Definition of Protocols</strong></h2><p>Protocols—such as TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, DNS, or blockchain consensus protocols like Ethereum—are:</p><ul><li><p>Shared rule-sets governing communication, coordination, state transitions, or settlement.</p></li><li><p>Adopted by many independent implementers.</p></li><li><p>Not owned by a single firm.</p></li></ul><p>Protocols define <strong>the feasible interaction space</strong> for all higher-layer actors.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>II. Structural Characteristics of Protocols</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Multi-implementer neutral governance</strong></h3><p>Protocols are implemented by many actors and cannot be controlled by any single one without losing interoperability.</p><h3><strong>2. Network effects and lock-in</strong></h3><p>Once adopted, protocols become deeply embedded, making coordination on alternatives extremely costly.</p><h3><strong>3. Non-appropriability</strong></h3><p>Protocols typically do not capture economic surplus directly; they shape it.</p><h3><strong>4. Constitutional role</strong></h3><p>Protocols operate analogously to constitutions: they define what is possible, not who wins.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>III. Protocol Power Defined</strong></h2><p><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Protocols define the structure of permissible interactions among applications, users, and services.</p><p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> Because protocols constrain interoperability, addressability, and transaction semantics, they exert structural power over all higher-layer forms of aggregation.</p><p><strong>Premise 3:</strong> Protocols alter the economic landscape by influencing:</p><ul><li><p>The capacity of firms to build moats</p></li><li><p>The degree of data openness</p></li><li><p>The ability of users to switch providers</p></li><li><p>The basic cost structure of transactions</p></li></ul><p><strong>Premise 4:</strong> Protocols do not meet Thompson’s definition of aggregators because they neither own user relationships nor scale as firms.</p><p><strong>Conclusion E (Protocol Power):</strong><br>Protocols possess <strong>constitutional power</strong>: the ability to shape the environment in which aggregators and suppliers compete, the rules of surplus distribution, and the permissible forms of coordination.</p><p>This is a form of structural, non-extractive power, distinct from the firm-level market power Aggregation Theory describes.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>SECTION III — Commentary: LLMs and the Reconfiguration of Aggregation and Protocol Power</strong></h1><p>LLMs introduce a shift at both layers: aggregation and protocol.</p><h2><strong>I. LLM Impact on Aggregation</strong></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Aggregation of knowledge</strong><br>LLMs do not aggregate suppliers in the traditional sense; they aggregate <strong>corpora</strong>, transforming heterogeneous sources into a generalizable model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Demand intermediation</strong><br>Users increasingly delegate search, selection, and synthesis tasks to LLMs. As a result, AI systems become the default interface for interacting with information—substituting for traditional aggregators.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supplier opacity</strong><br>Unlike search or marketplace aggregators, LLMs obscure supplier identity. This pushes commoditization to its logical extreme.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reinforcement dynamics</strong><br>LLMs improve with use, forming feedback loops similar to Thompson’s core flywheel but operating on inference quality rather than supplier diversity.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Result:</strong> AI-era aggregators mediate not consumption choices but <strong>belief formation and decision processes</strong>, representing a new epistemic form of aggregation.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>II. LLM Impact on Protocol Power</strong></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Protocol layer obscured</strong><br>LLMs mask the underlying technical stack from users. The significance of TCP/IP, HTTP, or even blockchain RPC interfaces becomes invisible to end-users who rely on natural language intermediaries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protocol relevance shifts to machine interfaces</strong><br>Protocols increasingly evolve to serve machine agents rather than humans. The next-generation HTTP equivalent may be optimized for LLM negotiation or autonomous agents.</p></li><li><p><strong>LLM-mediated interoperability</strong><br>LLMs may soften protocol boundaries by translating between incompatible standards, thereby reducing lock-in and weakening protocol-level structural power.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conversely, LLMs may increase reliance on shared models</strong><br>If widely deployed foundational models become effectively standard interaction substrates, they may function as <strong>de facto protocols</strong>, even if not governed like traditional ones.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>III. Joint Implications</strong></h2><p>Together, these shifts suggest:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Aggregation power moves upward</strong>: from managing transactions to managing cognition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protocol power moves sideways</strong>: from governing human–machine communication to governing machine–machine reasoning substrates.</p></li><li><p>The future contest may not be between aggregators and suppliers, but between <strong>epistemic aggregators</strong> (LLMs) and <strong>constitutional protocols</strong> (which define model training rights, compute access, or interoperability norms).</p></li></ul><p>In this sense, LLMs challenge and extend both theories: They behave like aggregators in their demand-centric logic, while simultaneously behaving like protocols in their infrastructural and standardizing effects.</p>
